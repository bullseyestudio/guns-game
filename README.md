Guns!, the tank game
====================

A 2D, top-down view game where the player can build their own tank and then
drive it against other tanks (driven by either an AI or other players), with
the objective of obliterating the enemy.

For most current documentation, there is a wiki article at
<http://wiki.narc.ro/a/Guns>.

Uses PGU (Phil's pyGame Utilities) -- see <http://code.google.com/p/pgu/>.

For convenience, PGU is included in the repository (thanks to it being so
tiny). PGU is released under the [GNU lesser GPL][lgpl].

License
-------

The source code of Guns is provided freely and openly at its [github project page][origin].
A final license for Guns has not been decided on yet, but will likely be
open-source, though the game itself (packaged nicely) will also be sold for a
small sum.

Installing and running
----------------------

As a series of Python scripts, installing mostly involves just unpacking the
game into some place. You will also want to install [Python 2.7][py] and [pyGame][pygame],
if you wish to run a development version.

In future, there will be prettier packages available... probably.

Authors
-------

Guns is currently being developed by a small team scattered across two
continents:

* narc0tiq (Octav Sandulescu) from Romania,
* EzTargetUK (Steven Harrison) from the UK, and
* Ethrel (Nathaniel Heintz) from Canada.

We accept contributions from outside the team -- if you have a patch you'd like
us to incorporate, just make a pull request on [the github project][origin].
