Python modules common to server and client go here.

This is going to be used only in the dev versions --releases of the game will
have copies of common/* embedded in their main working directories, to keep
from using an external reference.

As such, client and server should prefer using python modules and other
resources from their personal directories rather than from this common one, to
prevent surprise overrides in strange end-user environments.

What I mean is:
  sys.path.append('./modules')
THEN
  sys.path.append('../common/modules')
rather than the other way around.
